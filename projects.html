      <a class="text-link" href="resources/Phys130FinalProject.pdf">Nonlinear Quantum Optics with Rydberg Atoms</a> (Spring 2024, PHYS 130)</p>
      <p class="text-abstract">
      Abstract: 
      In this review paper, we explore how electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) and Rydberg interactions create nonlinear optical effects. We begin by dissecting the Hamiltonian for a ‘L’-type 
      three-level atomic system, and show how EIT arises. We then go over a derivation of the nonlinear susceptibility [1] and introduce Rydberg interactions to the ‘L’-type Hamiltonian. We then expand 
      from a single Rydberg atom to an ensemble of Rydberg atoms to examine the Rydberg superatom [2] and quantum metasurfaces [3]. Applications of these ideas for single photon sources [4] and 
      generating highly entangled photon states [3, 5] are then explored.</p>

      <a class="text-link" href="resources/Phys130MidtermProject.pdf">Generating Single Photons with Neutral Atoms</a> (Spring 2024, PHYS 130)</p>
      <p class="text-abstract"> Abstract: With the recent explosion of progress on neutral atoms as a platform for quantum information, single photon generation within an optical cavity has become essential for efficient transfer of information 
        between computing nodes or for use in a standalone approach to quantum computing. In 
        this review paper, I discuss current progress towards a bright, high-fidelity single photon source over 
        the past three decades by covering the basic theory of CQED spontaneous emission, experimental 
        realizations of such sources, metrics used to evaluate single photon quality, and methods to simulate 
        decay dynamics. I then explore attempts to use many-body interactions to generate single photons 
        and shape collective emissions with direct analogue to the Jaynes-Cumming Hamiltonian of neutral atom setups.  </p>

      <a class="text-link" href="resources/Math275FinalProject.pdf">Exploring the Hard-Core Bose-Hubbard Model through Exact
        Simulations</a> (Spring 2024, MATH 275)</p>
      <p class="text-abstract"> Abstract: In this paper we present Qiskit simulations for a XY spin model, which through the Jordan-Wigner 
        transform can be mapped to a 1D Hard-Core Bose-Hubbard model [VGR06] and many other toy models 
        of physical systems depending on the tuning of interaction strengths. This is done through an analytic 
        method that disentangles the XY model’s Hamiltonian [FV09, CL18]. We discuss the results of this 
        simulation [VGR06] and provide explicit circuits that were used in qiskit simulations. While a similar 
        simulation was done previously [CL18], the circuit was smaller (4 qubits as opposed to 8) and did not 
        explore different tuning parameters. Through these results, we better illustrate a general method first 
        proposed by [FV09] for the exact simulation of integrable Hamiltonians that can be mapped through the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Finally, we discuss possible extensions to richer models.

      <a class="text-link" href="resources/EE236A_Final_Project (1) (3).pdf">Optomechanical Isolator for Two Coupled Cavities</a> (Fall 2023, ELENG 236A)</p>
      <p class="text-abstract">
      Abstract: 
      With the increasing applications of cavity optomechanics for quantum information, addressing the
      challenge of creating an optical isolator is important for protecting devices from unwanted noise.
      In this project, I review a proposal [1] for an ideal optical isolator in a two-cavity system and
      explore some consequences of larger detunings and interaction strengths than shown in the paper. I
      also rederive the transmission amplitude calculations and comment on potential applications of this
      device, along with desirable qualities in the mechanical resonator and cavity coupling strength.</p>
